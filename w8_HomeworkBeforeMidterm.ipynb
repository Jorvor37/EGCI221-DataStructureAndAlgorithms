    "\n",
    "Ans: The ExtractMin operation in a d-ary min-heap involves the following steps:\n",
    "1. Remove the root element (the minimum element).\n",
    "2. Replace the root with the last element in the heap (the last element in the array).\n",
    "3. Restore the heap property by performing a \"down-heap\" or \"sift-down\" operation. \n",
